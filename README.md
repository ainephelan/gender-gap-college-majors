Using visualisations to communicate the historical narrative of the gender gap in different fields of study in the US.

## Context
The National Center for Education Statistics in the US releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women since 1970. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist from the University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set for years 1970 to 2012 and made it available on his personal website.

Gender parity is a topic close to my own heart, and at least here in Australia, it appears we still have a long way to go in bridging the gap.

News articles aside, let's use Randal's cleaned data to see some historical differences between the genders regarding their chosen fields of study in the US.

Note, due to the nature of the historical data available to us, for the purposes of this analysis we will be treating gender as a binary construct only.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to use the cleaned data set to create visualisations which communicate the historical narrative of the gender gap in different fields of study in the US.

We will use the opportunity to practice some techniques to eliminate chartjunk and maximise the data-ink ratio, so that our diagrams can be easily read and interpreted.
